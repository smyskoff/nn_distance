#+TITLE: Euclidean distance with neural network


* An idea
  Arguably, neural network can approximate any function. So I decided to try to
  build such a network which approximates distance between two objects on image.
  Not to concentrate on concrete object detection, I decided to generate toy
  dataset of images with black background and a pair of white points and expect
  the network approximates an Euclidean distance between these two points.

* Dataset
  Dataset is generated one. Size of dataset is selected to be arbitrary small
  not to allow network to learn all the "patters", but move towards
  generalization of the problem.

* Models
  Here's collected just a few models I put in order to be exposed to public.
  For the moment I did not intend to publish any valuable result, but provide
  some convenient playground, using [[https://keras.io/][Keras]] as a DL framework for convenient rapid
  prototyping.
